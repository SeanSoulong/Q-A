1. What is CSS and why is it used?
•	Answer: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style and format the layout of web pages created with HTML. CSS controls the visual appearance of a website, such as colors, fonts, margins, padding, layout, and responsiveness. It allows developers to separate content (HTML) from design (CSS), making it easier to manage and maintain the appearance of web pages.
2.	How can you link CSS to an HTML document?

        Answer: There are three main ways to apply CSS to an HTML document:

1.	External CSS: Use the <link> tag in the <head> section of the HTML document to link an external CSS file.

2.	Internal CSS: Use the <style> tag inside the <head> section of the HTML document.

3.	Inline CSS: Use the style attribute directly within an HTML element.




3. What is the CSS Box Model?
•	Answer: The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are structured and spaced on a web page. Each element is treated as a rectangular box consisting of four parts:
1.	Content: The actual content of the element, like text or images.
2.	Padding: Space between the content and the border. It adds inner spacing around the content.
3.	Border: A boundary around the padding (or content if there is no padding).
4.	Margin: Space outside the border that separates the element from other elements on the page.
